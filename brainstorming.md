Having a translator with you is always helpful when traveling to another country. As a traveler, if nobody understands your language, you **will** need a translator. This app is an app where users could translate text in real time from one language to another with it. AI could make the translator become more intelligent over time.

### :small_blue_diamond: Expected Challenges:
1. Making sure the translations are accurate and reliable in **real-time** will be challenging, especially for languages with complex grammar and nuances. AI models may struggle with context-dependent translations and slang expressions
2. Supporting a wide range of languages and dialects will naturally give me problems like character encoding and translation quality

### :small_blue_diamond: Expected Techniques for Solution:

1. Continuous improvement and training of the AI model using large datasets and user feedback are essential to enhance accuracy over time
2. Prioritizing languages based on user demographics and travel destinations while ensuring consistent translation quality across all supported languages is crucial. Collaboration with linguists and native speakers can help improve translation accuracy and cultural relevance

Will need backend components to handle server-side logic, data storage, and communication with external services. For the backend, I can use Swift frameworks like Vapor or Perfect, or integrate with backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platforms such as Firebase or AWS Amplify. These backend solutions may allow me to implement features like user authentication, data storage, and real-time updates for your app
