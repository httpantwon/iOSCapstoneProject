A lot of people cancel trips because they can't afford them. These problems arise as a result of poor financial management. An innovative travel app suggests a budget-friendly itinerary. This app suggests places to stay that are less expensive, trips that save time, and various deals and discounts. As a result, it is simpler for people who enjoy traveling to plan trips without worrying about their finances.

## :pencil: Challenges

### :small_blue_diamond: Expected Challenges:
1. Gathering accurate and reliable data on accommodation prices, transportation options, deals, and discounts
2. To create algorithms, I would need a deep understanding of travel costs, time constraints, and user preferences to create personalized suggestions

### :small_blue_diamond: Expected Techniques for Solution (respectively):

1. I could use APIs from trusted sources like Expedia, Hotels.com, etc., flight aggregators, and deal websites. I also need ot regularly update my database to make sure information is accurate
2. For difficult algorithms, gather user feedback and behavior data to continuously improve the accuracy of recommendations. Thoroughly test and refine algorithms to make sure they provide relevant and personalized suggestions


## :beginner: App Idea #2

**:small_blue_diamond:Project Name:** Local Translator App
**:small_blue_diamond:Leader:** Antwon Walls  
**:small_blue_diamond:Budget:** $0  
**:small_blue_diamond:Contributors:** None  
**:small_blue_diamond:Target Audience:** People who are foreign to their vacation destination's language
**:small_blue_diamond:Expected Launch Date:** 2026

Having a translator with you is always helpful when traveling to another country. As a traveler, if nobody understands your language, you **will** need a translator. This app is an app where users could translate text in real time from one language to another with it. AI could make the translator become more intelligent over time.
:::

## :pencil: Challenges

### :small_blue_diamond: Expected Challenges:
1. Making sure the translations are accurate and reliable in **real-time** will be challenging, especially for languages with complex grammar and nuances. AI models may struggle with context-dependent translations and slang expressions
2. Supporting a wide range of languages and dialects will naturally give me problems like character encoding and translation quality

### :small_blue_diamond: Expected Techniques for Solution:

1. Continuous improvement and training of the AI model using large datasets and user feedback are essential to enhance accuracy over time
2. Prioritizing languages based on user demographics and travel destinations while ensuring consistent translation quality across all supported languages is crucial. Collaboration with linguists and native speakers can help improve translation accuracy and cultural relevance
